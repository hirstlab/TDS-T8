"""
Central safety limits and timing constants for the TDS-T8 rig.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Previously, magic numbers were scattered across multiple modules: PID timing
literals in the executor loop, pressure thresholds in display units inside
DataAcquisition, temperature overrides in SafetyMonitor, and clamp limits
duplicated across files.

Consolidating these numbers here ensures every tunable and safety threshold has
exactly one canonical home and one documented justification (ADRs 0002–0004).
