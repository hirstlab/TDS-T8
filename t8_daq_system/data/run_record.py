t8_daq_system/data/run_record.py

CSV log writer for the Rig's step-7 Snapshot stream (ticket rig-architecture-11).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Previously, CSV rows were assembled inside a closure in MainWindow._on_snapshot,
running on the Rig thread and computing Block_Index in three separate places.
Display-unit conversion, sched-state extraction, and raw-voltage lookup were all
interleaved with the GUI callback, making the column schema impossible to test
in isolation and coupling the log format to GUI state.

RunRecord owns the column schema.  build_row() is a pure function (no I/O, no
state) that converts a Snapshot into a column dict.  The writer thread drains a
queue of Snapshots and events, writes one data row per sample_rate_ms, and writes
event rows immediately.  Shutdown is sentinel-based: stop() enqueues _STOP and
joins the thread — no time.sleep, testable with ManualClock.
